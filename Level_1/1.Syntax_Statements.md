# Syntax
## Let's break up simple code given below
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
```
1.  **#include <iostream>** ->  is a header file library that lets us work with input and output objects, such as cout (used in line 5). Header files add functionality to C++ programs.
<iostream> pronounced  "input-output stream = i o stream".
2.  **using namespace std;**->  Means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library.
#include and namespaces we will discuss much later in level 5, so don't worry if you don't understand them. Just remember that they always should be in your code.
3.  **int main() {}** ->  Another thing that always appear in a C++ program is int main(). This is called a function. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be execute.
4.  **cout** ->  (pronounced "see-out") is an object used together with the insertion operator (<<) to output/print text. In our example, it will output "Hello World!".
5.  **return 0;** ->  ends the main function without errors
##                 
**Note**:  A blank line. C++ ignores white spaces. But we use it to make the code more readable.

**Note**:  After each code line type ; . Semi-column signalises to cpp that "this line is finished,now move to next step".

**Interesting feature**: The body of int main() could also been written as:**int main () { cout << "Hello World! "; return 0; }**

**Interesting feature**: You may seen codes without namespace. It can be replaced with ::, like:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
cout << "Hi";
return 0;
}
```
## Can be replaces by ***hemorrhoid*** std::cout
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(){
std::cout << "Hi";
return 0;
}
```

# Statements
As was mentioned above code line must end with semi-column(;), they are called ***Statements***.
Here are few statements for example:
```cpp
cout << "Happy Day";
cout << "Please Die😢";
return 0;
```
